= Malware Development Using Rust
:page-aliases: root, home

This is how I am learning malware development from scratch through Rust (and the windows api).


https://maldevacademy.com[MalDev Academy] is a great place to learn malware development however it heavily focuses on writing C/C++.
I wanted to try using Rust directly hence I am learning 3 things at once: Rust, Windows API, and malware development.
